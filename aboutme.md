### Origins

About 4 years ago I arrived in Berlin, Germany having saved up enough cash and passed the right tests to get a placement in the Medical Neurosciences International Graduate Program at the Charit√© University Hospital. Pretty quickly I caught on that data was hotter than neuro - and that my training (in writing software for functional magnetic resonance imaging experiments and analyzing the large amounts of data they produced) would give me a leg-up. 

Ultimately, I've pursued a career in data because it provides a fun & up-tempo route to professional and cognitive satisfaction.

### Perspective

I've worked with data in the context of consultancies, early-stage startups, hospitals, academia, and even a few military sites. If I have to choose, the consultancy experience has probably been the most challenging and rewarding. The common denominator is individuality. It's humbling to learn something new from each `fresh` new scenario - you don't know what you don't know. 

The `perspective` that I bring at [jyde](https://jyde.io) is open, interested, and curious. With that, the engineering comes organically. When designing and implementing data products, I value both innovation and practicality. Cookiecutters only get you from 'nothing' to 'something'. In order to make a meaningful impact, you've got to adapt and iterate - until the rest are adapting to you.

### Skills 

I have professional data engineering experience from architecting to front-end data product delivery. I'm always honing my software development skills in a [T-shape](https://medium.com/quick-code/what-it-is-a-t-shaped-developer-and-why-you-should-be-one-e87293e4bb84), with *a focus on Python software solutions for extract-transform-load (ETL) data integration on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud*.

My broader skillset includes: modern web-crawling with Javascript; automating pipelines with Apache Airflow; text analytics with Python and ElasticSearch; dashboarding with Microsoft Power BI; Dockerizing everything; maintaining Kubernetes apps with Helm; and data warehousing with AWS Athena, AWS Glue, and AWS S3.


### Call to Action

I look forward to you reaching out as a colleague or client - and especially welcome those interested in a mentor / mentee relationship.

That's all I got.

Daniel
