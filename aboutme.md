### Origins

About 4 years ago I arrived in Berlin, Germany having saved up enough cash and passed the right tests to get a placement in the Medical Neurosciences International Graduate Program at the Charit√© University Hospital. Pretty quickly I caught on that data was hotter than neuro - and that my training (in writing software for functional magnetic resonance imaging experiments and analyzing the large amounts of data they produced) would give me a leg-up. 

Ultimately, I've pursued a career in data because it provides a fun & up-tempo route to professional and cognitive satisfaction.

### Perspective

I've worked with data in the context of 'Fortune-500' companies, early-stage startups, hospitals, academic laboratories, and even a few military sites. It's fun to learn something new from each `fresh` new scenario. The `perspective` that I bring at [jyde](https://jyde.io) is open, careful, and curious. I value both innovation and return on investment. Making an impact comes down to adapting, iterating, and evaluating - both internally and externally. You know you've done it when the rest are adapting to you.

### Skills 

I have professional data engineering experience from architecting to front-end - and specialize in delivering data as a product (DAAP). I constantly hone my software development skills in a [T-shape](https://medium.com/quick-code/what-it-is-a-t-shaped-developer-and-why-you-should-be-one-e87293e4bb84), with *a focus on Python software solutions for extract-transform-load (ETL) data integration on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud*.

My broader skillset includes: modern web-crawling with JavaScript; automating pipelines with Apache Airflow; text analytics with Python and ElasticSearch; dashboarding with Microsoft Power BI; Dockerizing everything; scaling infrastructure with Kubernetes and Terraform; and warehousing data with AWS Athena, AWS Glue, and AWS S3.


### Call to Action

I look forward to you reaching out as a colleague or client - and especially welcome those interested in a mentor / mentee relationship.

That's all I got.

Daniel
