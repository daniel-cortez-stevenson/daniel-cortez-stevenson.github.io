subtitle: It's been a wild ride.

About 4 years ago I arrived in Berlin, Germany having saved up enough cash and passed the right tests to get a placement in the Medical Neurosciences International Graduate Program at the esteemed Charit√© University Hospital. Pretty quickly I caught on that data was hotter than neuro, and would provide a more unconventional route to professional and cognitive satisfaction. 

And so, while I learned a lot, I ducked out in the last semester of the program to pursue a career in data on a 'more than full-time' basis. Thing is, when folks start paying you to do something you're passionate about - you have to make even more time for it so your passion doesn't get eaten up by the grind of the 40 hour work week.

I've worked data-centric jobs in the context of consultancies, early-stage startups, hospitals, academia, and even a few military sites. If I have to choose, the consultancy experience has probably been the most challenging and rewarding. I've had fast-tempo international clients in the "Fortune XXX" and advised some relaxed folks out in California powering high-growth startups - and I gotta say, the common denominator is individuality. It's humbling to learn something new from each `fresh` new scenario - you don't know what you don't know, and you for sure don't know another folk's business! 

The `perspective` that I bring (at [jyde](https://jyde.io) is open, interested, and curious. With that, the engineering comes organically. Cookiecutters only get you from 'nothing' to 'something' - but, in order to make a meaningful impact, you got to adapt and iterate until the rest are adapting to you.

That's all I got, in terms of a rant, for now.
